  <h1>Under Construction</h1>
  <p>Welcome. To tell you something about myself, I am a career desktop support/sysadmin. I am currently working as a data analyst who tends to code as a
    hobby. I work with Python and C#, though admittedly, my knowledge may be broken in some areas, but I am seeking to improve with some practice.</p>
